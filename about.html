                            <h2>My Education:</h2>
                            <p>I graduated from the Foreign Languages High School "Simeon Radev" in Pernik, where I initially enrolled in the English program. However, in my second year, I transferred to the French program to pursue an intensive study of the language, driven by my strong interest in mastering it.

                                After completing high school, I faced some uncertainty about the direction of my higher education. Among the excellent universities in Sofia offering Computer Science programs, I ultimately chose to study Information Technologies at New Bulgarian University. I am currently in my third year of this program.</p>

                            <h2>My Work Experience Into Details:</h2>
                            <h4>First Job As A Payroll Accountant</h4>
                            <p>I secured my first job as a Payroll Accountant through a local Facebook group where people post job opportunities or searches. Initially, I had little knowledge about the role, but the supportive team created the ideal environment for me to learn and grow.
                                My manager was particularly inspiring—not just a supervisor but also a mentor and friend. She is a highly skilled professional with expertise in accounting, human resources, law, and teaching. In fact, she also teaches the fundamentals of payroll accounting, which greatly enriched my learning experience.
                                I started this job during the summer before my senior year of high school and continued working there until the end of my first year at university. During this time, I gained valuable insights into payroll accounting and developed both professionally and personally, acquiring skills that have positively impacted all areas of my life.
                            </p>
                            <h4>My Cuurent Job As A Junior Quality Assurance Engineer</h4>
                            <p>A few months after leaving my role as a Payroll Accountant, I began searching for opportunities in the IT industry. My manager at my previous job suggested exploring a career in Quality Assurance (QA), which piqued my interest. To pursue this path, I completed a QA Basics course at SoftUni, where I discovered a genuine passion for the profession.

                                I began applying for QA-related positions, and among the companies that reached out, Nemetschek stood out as my preferred choice. I am now part of their team, where I have gained extensive knowledge not only in software testing but also across various technology domains.
                                
                                Currently, I work as a manual tester, but I am highly motivated to transition into automation QA. I am already familiar with several relevant technologies and am actively pursuing additional training to achieve this goal.</p>

                            <h2>My Hobbies:</h2>
                            <p>From a young age, sports have been an integral part of my life. I began playing tennis at around four years old and have continued ever since. Over time, I was inspired by my father and brother to incorporate gym workouts and running into my routine to enhance my tennis performance.

                                Currently, the gym has become my primary activity. I view it not just as a hobby but as a vital part of maintaining a healthy and disciplined lifestyle. In addition to fitness, I have recently developed a passion for snowboarding, which has quickly become one of my favorite pastimes. I am also an avid enthusiast of fine watches and cars, interests that reflect my appreciation for craftsmanship and design.</p>
